So, what's going on today? I feel so tired all the time, it's so bad I can't leave my bed. You were courageous to reach out to me today, Do you want to talk about what’s going on? I guess, I just don't have anything to do or anyone to talk with right now. I’m hearing that you’re feeling fatigued and alone due to the constraints of quarantine. Ya but I feel like its stupid for me to feel this way. It’s understandable to feel isolated during a global pandemic.
