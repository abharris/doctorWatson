How are you feeling today? I’m feeling pretty down right now - I just can’t stop crying, and I’m not excited about doing things like I used to be. It sounds like you’re in a painful place - do you want to talk about what’s going on? I’m so lost, just tell me what to do. Feeling lost can be so frustrating - I’m curious, what does help look like for you today?
